# Formal Catch Up

* Not coding comprehension, memorization, or output
* Your compensation is a function of market (experience), role (value), band (tenure), output (proficiency)
* Your success with Bloc is a function of time management, personal development, moving through the curriculum, and code comprehension

## Muscle Memory

* Google · Knowing how to search for help
* Debugging · Always having a next step to try
* Momentum · Ship something every day (didn’t say code)

## Github Contribution History

* Great success = any commit pushed up every day
* Fail wail = nothing pushed up
* 3 strikes and we’re both out

## Students who fall behind affect me on both a professional and personal level

* I used to be the student who was always behind
* Sometimes I was being lazy · it’s healthy to not do anything sometimes (see below)
* Sometimes I was spending a lot of time trying to do things right, then realizing I wasn’t focused on the right things

## Personal Development

* Already acknowledged: Work-Life Balance & Sleep
* Rest is good · 1 hour per day, 1 day per week, and 1 week per year
* Time management · this can be scientific · what do you do everyday
* Parkinson’s law · time blocking · Back to Github Contributions · start with 30 minutes, then 60, then 90
* For my job, everyday I try to do 3 to 5 90 minute blocks where I deliver something substantial, doesn’t always work
* There are things you do that are valuable to yourself, valuable to your team, and valuable to the company/client
* Read the directions, either copy and paste code or write code, then write documentation about your thought process, anything you learned, or shortcuts for next time · this documentation should live alongside your code · try using a readme.md file for now
